# Recuiting for E-Agle TRT (HW)

Welcome to the recruitment _test_ for E-Agle TRT.

This _test_ is meant to give us the possibility to have a first understandment of the capabilities of our applicants without the applicants having the pressure of seeing it as an exam.

Moreover it's studied so that the applicants gets a first taste of the tools used so that once in the team you can get up and running quickly into the team workflow without having to learn stuff under pressure while it's needed.

## What we'll look into

 - Understanding of basic electronics
 - Components choice and their suitability
 - KiCad
   - Schematic choices, tidyness and good practices
   - Board layout understanding and, again, good practices
 - `git` usage: fork, branch, clone, commit push, pull

## Assignment

Develop a DCDC converter:

 - Input voltage in range 11V-17V
 - Two outputs of:
   - 5V3A
   - 3.3V0.5A
 - In the schematic use also a hierarchical sheet
   - _It's not a good practice for this small of a project but it's for letting you learn about hierarchy without the hassle of a more complex assignment_

 - Commit your progress along the way
